# Wash-trading-mechanisms 
This repository consists of the code used in my Master thesis 'Wash trading mechanisms'. <br>

Before we can run the code we have to prepare the data. <br>
For Mt.Gox, we have to extract the daily wash trading volume by running the file prewash_file.<br>
For the Google Trends proxies, we have to run the GT_GOX and GT_IDEXED files.<br>

Then, downloading the other data sources, one can replicate the code for every analysis.<br>
!Note, to download complete_edge_v2, see https://www.kaggle.com/code/xblock/starter-mt-gox-leaked-transaction/data.<br>
!Note, to completely replicate the wash trading volume of IDEX/EtherDelta, one can use the code on from https://github.com/friedhelmvictor/lob-dex-wash-trading-paper. <br>

The final analysis files are:<br>
The Mt.Gox analysis is called GOX_analysis.<br>
The EtherDelta analysis is called ED analysis.<br>
The IDEX analysis is called IDEX_analysis.<br>
